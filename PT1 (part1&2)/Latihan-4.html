    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>

    <p>There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The U.S. Bureau of
        <span style="color:red;">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics </span>Labor Statistics  projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is
    more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a
    software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S.
    workers.</p>

    <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of
        software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often
        beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming
        can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming
        experience.</p>

        <p>The <span style="color:rgb(0, 78, 196) ;">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program </span> at Northeastern University is
            specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another
            field of study.</p>

        <p style=" text-align: center;"><spanv s>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come
            out as software engineers,” </spanv> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer
            science programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and a
            variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</p>

              Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills,
              it helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the
              most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job
              postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for
              those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.
